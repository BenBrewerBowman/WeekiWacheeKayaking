########################### NOTES ABOUT ASPECTS OF WEBSITE ###########################

Header and Footer
- the problem of having to change the header and footer code of each page was brought up
- after some research, four solution options were found
	1. create a template.html that has the header and footer included, then copy that file and add the page specific content
	2. use php: create a header.php and footer.php then use <?php include('header.php')?> and <?php include('footer.php')?> in each page
	3. use javascript/jquery: create header.html and footer.html and load them in the <body> (ex: $("#header").load("header.html);)
	4. conserve the header and footer in the index.html and load the subpage in a <div> or <iframe> in the between the header and footer
- seems that option 2 seems to the most common suggestion, but to keep things simple development will continue at this time with option 1


Information Architecture
- needs to be established...
- Homepage
	- Homepage is the first thing that viewers will see - make a good impression
	- Homepage will include an overview of the service while creatively adding the advertising points of the business
		- service description: kayak rental/tour of the river/kayak races/treasure-scavenger hunt
		- service includes: rental (all equipment), launch, pick up, private lot to park
		- advertising points:
			- manatees
			- beautiful, clear river
			- 


Responsive Layout
- Simply one breakpoint at viewport width of 1015px
- for viewport widths > 1015px
	- Header will include the links to other pages with the center logo being a link to the homepage.
	  The group of links is set at width of 1000px, and will stay centered as viewport width increases (using 'margin: auto') 
	- Footer will be made of three sections (contact, social media, and legal information) of different widths that add up to 1000px.
	  The sections group is fixed at width 1000px, and will stay centered as viewport width increases (using 'margin: auto')
- for viewport widths <= 1015px
	- Header will include the logo in the center (using 'margin: auto') which is also link to homepage.
	  Header then includes a menu button that's on the left, the menu has the four other links that the larger header has.
	- Footer will still maintain the three sections but they will be 'display: block' on separate lines and content in the sections will be centered
	  Additionally, the font-size is decreased in the Legal section
